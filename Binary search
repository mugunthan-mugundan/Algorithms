Always use the standard binary search algorithm. The starting points and the end points are inclusive. the left or r always moves by one. R goes left, l goes right. the test is always (l <= r).

There are lot of places a modified binary search yields better results than a linear scan.

In Binary search what heuristic you can use for making the decision to go one side or another is what trims the search space.
Sometimes binary search is used in places like insert sort. However be careful when inserting, you may have to insert at the end or before start. 

Be careful when you are not exiting from inside the search. In those cases you can potentially use either l or r as the value. 

There are cases where you can keep updating e.g. minimum value repeatedly during binary search and at the exit you would have the answer.
