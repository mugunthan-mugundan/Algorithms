Many sequence problems can be solved by the sliding Window technique

Also, for some problems you may have to use a sorted dictionary.

  foreach(var num in nums)
        {
            int val = 0;
            process.TryGetValue(num, out val);
            process[num] = val + 1;
        }
        var keys = process.Keys.ToArray();
        foreach(var key in keys)
        {
            var val = process[key];
            if(val == 0) continue;
            for(int i = key; i < key + k; i++)
            {
                int next = 0;
                process.TryGetValue(i, out next);
                if(next < val)
                {
                    return false;
                }
                process[i] = next -val;
            }
        }
